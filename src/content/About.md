Born and raised in snowy Syracuse, New York, I was introduced to filmmaking at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School. Very quickly, I found myself watching every movie I could get my hands on.  After graduate school at The London Film School, I moved to Los Angeles to start my career. 

I am proud of my years of experience working in the grip and electric departments, as well as my years as a Local 600 1st AC and Camera Operator. The technical foundation those years provided me gave me the confidence and know-how to navigate any situation. 

Story and character is where I get inspired. I pride myself on my ability to truly let the story, and the Director’s vision, guide my visual strategies.  I love being in the trenches with my collaborators and always aim to support them and help them make the best film possible!

I am a proud member of the International Cinematographers Guild, and an honored recipient of a 2021 ICG Emerging Cinematographer Award.
