Born and raised in snowy Syracuse, New York, I was introduced to filmmaking at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School. Very quickly, I found myself watching every movie I could get my hands on.  My desire to learn more about the craft led me to The London Film School, where I discovered the true beauty of the collaborative process.

I am proud of my years of experience working in the grip and electric departments, as well as my years as a Local 600 1st AC and Camera Operator. The technical foundation those years gave me has given me the confidence and know-how to navigate most situations. But, as a cinematographer, story and character is where I truly get inspired. I pride myself on my ability to truly let the story, and the Director’s vision, guide my visual strategies.

I am a proud member of the International Cinematographers Guild, and an honored recipient of a 2021 ICG Emerging Cinematographer Award.
